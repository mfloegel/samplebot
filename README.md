# Build a bot 

## Set up project

### If you have a package.json

Create a folder for your bot, cd into it, copy all code over and run npm install to install all things in package.json.  So, in terminal type:

    npm install


### If there is no package.json

Create a folder for your bot, cd into it, and run npm init to begin a project.  So, in terminal type:

    npm init
    
Get the BotBuilder (use latest when saving botbuilder below, otherwise just `3.5.4`) and Restify modules using npm.

    npm install --save botbuilder@3.5.4
    npm install --save restify

## Test Locally

Back in terminal:

    node server.js

In the botemulator desktop app:

* Select app on port (usually 3978)
* Keep app id and app password blank
* Hit connect
* Type a message to the bot and wait for a response (you could start with "Hey bot!" or "Bye")

## Exercises

Take a look at the `server.js` in this folder in VSCode or chosen editor.  Follow along in the code, commenting and uncommenting sections, to create different bot experiences.

Have some fun!
